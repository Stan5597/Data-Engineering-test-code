# Data-Engineering-test-code
Throughout this project, I have been challenged rigorously and I have learned alot. Many of the concepts I have been exposed for the first time and it was a great learning opportunities. And I am still learning.

The task was to write a Pythpon script that traverses through the csv file in a zip folder and combine them. It should do it for any added cvs file.

My script, succesfully travers through the zip folder and read the files.
I could not add them together.
